2. **Anti-Inflammatory Effects**:

   - Black seed oil has been studied for its potential anti-inflammatory properties. Compounds in the oil may help reduce inflammation in the body, which could be beneficial for managing conditions related to chronic inflammation.

3. **Immune System Support**:

   - Black seed oil has been investigated for its potential immunomodulatory effects. It may help enhance the activity of certain immune cells and support the body's defense mechanisms against infections.
