L-citrulline malate is a compound that combines the amino acid L-citrulline with malic acid. It is commonly used as a dietary supplement and has gained attention for its potential benefits in various areas. here are some potential benefits of L-citrulline malate:

1. **Improved Exercise Performance**:

   - L-citrulline malate is often used as a pre-workout supplement due to its potential to enhance exercise performance. It is believed to contribute to increased energy levels, reduced muscle fatigue, and improved endurance during high-intensity workouts.

2. **Reduced Muscle Fatigue and Soreness**:

   - L-citrulline malate has been suggested to have the potential to reduce muscle fatigue and post-exercise muscle soreness. It may contribute to better recovery after intense physical activity.

3. **Nitric Oxide Production and Vasodilation**:

   - L-citrulline malate is a precursor to L-arginine, which can increase the body's production of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that helps relax blood vessels, potentially leading to improved blood flow, nutrient delivery, and oxygen supply to muscles.

4. **Ammonia Detoxification**:

   - L-citrulline malate may support the body's ability to detoxify ammonia, a byproduct of protein metabolism that can contribute to fatigue and discomfort during exercise.
   
   - **References**:

5. **Cardiovascular Health**:

   - Some research suggests that L-citrulline malate might have cardiovascular benefits by improving blood vessel function, reducing blood pressure, and supporting overall heart health.
