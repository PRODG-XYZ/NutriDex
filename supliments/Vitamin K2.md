Vitamin K2, also known as menaquinone, is a lesser-known form of vitamin K that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes within the body. While research on Vitamin K2 is ongoing and some of its potential benefits are still being explored, here are some areas where it is believed to have potential health effects:

1. **Bone Health**: Vitamin K2 is believed to play a role in bone health by supporting the deposition of calcium into bones and teeth. It helps activate proteins that regulate calcium metabolism, potentially reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures.

   - Knapen MHJ, et al. (2013). Three-year low-dose menaquinone-7 supplementation helps decrease bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women. Osteoporosis International, 24(9), 2499-2507.
   - Bolton-Smith C, et al. (2007). Two-year randomized controlled trial of vitamin K1 (phylloquinone) and vitamin D3 plus calcium on the bone health of older women. The Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, 22(4), 509-519.

2. **Cardiovascular Health**: Vitamin K2 is thought to have a potential role in cardiovascular health by regulating calcium deposition in arteries and preventing arterial calcification, which is a risk factor for heart disease.

   - Geleijnse JM, et al. (2004). Dietary intake of menaquinone is associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease: the Rotterdam Study. The Journal of Nutrition, 134(11), 3100-3105.
   - Beulens JWJ, et al. (2009). High dietary menaquinone intake is associated with reduced coronary calcification. Atherosclerosis, 203(2), 489-493.

3. **Blood Clotting**: Vitamin K, including Vitamin K2, is essential for proper blood clotting. It helps activate proteins involved in the coagulation process, preventing excessive bleeding.

   - Tie J, et al. (2015). Vitamin K compounds in total parenteral nutrition for cholestasis in neonates. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 12, CD006975.

4. **Cancer Prevention**: Some research suggests that Vitamin K2 might have a role in cancer prevention by influencing cell growth and differentiation. It's being investigated for its potential to inhibit the growth of certain cancer cells.

   - Nimptsch K, et al. (2008). Dietary vitamin K intake in relation to cancer incidence and mortality: results from the Heidelberg cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Heidelberg). The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 87(5), 985-992.
   - Shearer MJ. (2009). Vitamin K metabolism and nutriture. Blood Reviews, 23(2), 41-50.

5. **Diabetes and Insulin Sensitivity**: Emerging research suggests that Vitamin K2 might have a role in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.

   - Yoshida M, et al. (2018). Effects of vitamin K in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Nutrients, 10(6), 735.
   - Vermeer C, et al. (2012). Beyond deficiency: potential benefits of increased intakes of vitamin K for bone and vascular health. European Journal of Nutrition, 51(6), 723-731.

6. **Skin Health**: Some preliminary studies suggest that Vitamin K2 might contribute to skin health by supporting wound healing and reducing the appearance of certain skin conditions.

   - Logan A, et al. (2019). A randomized controlled trial of the effect of phylloquinone supplementation on the inflammation mediators of peripheral arterial disease. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 109(6), 1618-1627.
